# nn

This is just a simple reimplementation of a convolutional neuronal network - mostly to test my own understanding of AI. If anybody else can learn from this  project, that'd be a bonus :)

Python implementation under "prototype", c++ implementation (still unfinished) under "src". 

TODO: 
 - complete CNN
 - training on mnist
 - rebuilt c++ implementation
